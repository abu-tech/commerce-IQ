## Some Points Related To My Submission

- I have used MongoDB to complete the assignment instead of a JSON file(As i got permission from you in the mail), I did so just to get extra points as mentioned in the doc and rest the functionality is exactly the same as asked.
- Implemented caching using Redis for some apiâ€™s to improve the performance.
